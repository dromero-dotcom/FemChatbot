    text: Gender pay gap is the average difference between the income of men and women who are working, as a percentage of the income of men. For example, a gpg of 20% means on avg. women earn only 80 cents for each 1 EUR/USD/GBP that men earn. In contrast, a gpg of -5% means on avg. women earn 1.05 for every EUR/USD/GBP that men earn.

    text: Here are seven top tips for salary negotiation
  utter_nego_tip_01:
  - image: https://images.pexels.com/photos/4386339/pexels-photo-4386339.jpeg
    text: Do your homework on your 'operating-cash-flow'. Determine how much cash NET you need every month, then calculate the equivalent GROSS salary, taking into account income tax and other contributions.
  utter_nego_tip_02:
  - image: https://images.pexels.com/photos/6694927/pexels-photo-6694927.jpeg
    text: Do your homework on the market. Find out how much your skills are worth for your target role(s), industries and your location (use salary surveys).
  utter_nego_tip_03:
  - image: https://images.pexels.com/photos/6694955/pexels-photo-6694955.jpeg
    text: Find your MAN (Minimum Acceptable Number). Be prepared to walk-away and decline a final offer if it's less than this value.
  utter_nego_tip_04:
  - image: https://images.pexels.com/photos/3761018/pexels-photo-3761018.jpeg
    text: Don't be the first one to give a number. Let them go first making an offer or giving a salary range. Only if they push hard, give an "indicative" salary, saying you're "open for further negotiation".
  utter_nego_tip_05:
  - image: https://images.pexels.com/photos/1095601/pexels-photo-1095601.jpeg
    text: Take your time. Don't respond immediately to a first offer. Take a couple of days to think it over and come back with a counter-proposal. Try to negotiate a bit more compensation (base salary/bonus) or other benefits.
  utter_nego_tip_06:
  - image: https://images.pexels.com/photos/6953833/pexels-photo-6953833.jpeg
    text: Negotiate other perks! If base pay and bonus are final, you can still try additional benefits e.g., housing or relocation allowance, flexible working hours, better job title, training and development, etc.
  utter_nego_tip_07:
  - image: https://images.pexels.com/photos/6953835/pexels-photo-6953835.jpeg
    text: Keep your emotions in check during the whole negotiation. Above all, stay calm, positive, polite and professional.
