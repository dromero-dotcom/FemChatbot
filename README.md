Development of a Feminist Chatbot: ABIE (Adviser for Better Income Equality).

By David A. Romero Pi√±a.

ABIE is a chatbot that gives tips on salary negotiation and shows gender-pay-gap (GPG) statistics.
The GPG annual average figures are available for several developed countries and for selected (large) UK-based companies, which are legally required to report their GPG every year.
ABIE can also "defend" itself from sexist and abusive input from users; it will rebuke a user that gives inappropriate input (insults/sexist language/harassment).
As a minor feature, the chatbot can also give the current time at its location, if asked for it.

This chatbot was developed using RASA OpenSource 2.7.1, RASA-X 0.40.1, RASA-SDK 2.7.0., spaCy 3.1 and Python 3.7.6.
